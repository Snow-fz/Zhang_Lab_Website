                          <br>
                          Multimodality brain imaging is a promising and
                          recent approach to study the function and
                          structure of the brain by collecting multiple
                          types of data from the same individual using
                          various imaging techniques (fMRI, fNIRS, MRI,
                          DTI, EEG, etc.). This allows the examination
                          of complex brain functions and diseases from
                          different imaging techniques, which can yield
                          important insights that are only partially
                          detected by each modality. At the same time,
                          however, the advent of multimodal neuroimaging
                          has brought the urgent need to develop new
                          data integration methods that can capitalize
                          on the strength of each modality and make full
                          usage of the data dimensionality and
                          informational complexity<br>
                          <br>
                          Using data from the Philadelphia
                          Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) study, we
                          identify three distinct groups, people with
                          trauma exposure and no post-traumatic stress
                          disorder (PTSD) symptoms, people with trauma
                          exposure and long-lasting PTSD symptoms as
                          well as healthy controls. A large number of
                          imaging features from different modalities
                          including MRI, DTI, and resting-state fMRI are
                          derived. We then develop an integrative
                          probabilistic model to combine heterogeneous
                          data from multiple modalities and select
                          predictive multimodal imaging signatures of
                          PTSD.<br>

                          <br>
                          Recent advances in human neuroimaging have
                          shown that it is possible to accurately decode
                          how the brain perceives information based only
                          on non-invasive function magnetic resonance
                          imaging (fMRI) measurements of brain activity.
                          Two common statistical approaches include
                          univariate analysis and multivariate pattern
                          analysis (MVPA).<br>
                          <br>
                          In one of our projects, we investigated the
                          representation and processing of auditory
                          categories within the human temporal cortex
                          using high resolution fMRI and MVPA methods.
                          More importantly, we considered decoding
                          multiple sound categories simultaneously
                          through multi-class support vector
                          machine-recursive feature elimination
                          (MSVM-RFE) as our MVPA tool. Results show that
                          the model MSVM-RFE was able to learn the
                          functional relation between the multiple sound
                          categories and the corresponding evoked
                          spatial patterns for both within-subject and
                          across-subject classifications. <br>
                          <br>
                          Another project involves the segmentation of
                          multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
                          images with multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions.
                          Accurate identification of MS lesions is
                          essential for MS diagnosis, assessment of
                          disease progression, and evaluation of
                          treatment efficacy. However, it is a
                          challenging task due to the variability in
                          lesion location, size and shape in addition to
                          anatomical variability between subjects. In
                          this work, we developed an integrative
                          classification model that incorporates
                          information from different resources to
                          achieve robust and reliable segmentation
                          results. </font><br>

                          The integrated measurement of diet, physical
                          activity, and the built environment is another
                          important application of big data integration.
                          Recent advances in wearable computing through
                          the use of accelerometers, smartphones, and
                          other devices for tracking individuals and
                          individual behavior, have created a rich
                          opportunity for the integrated measurement of
                          environmental context and behavior. For
                          example, combined GPS and accelerometer units
                          can be used to measure both intensity of
                          physical activity and the setting in which
                          this activity occurred.<br>
                          <br>
                          Through collaboration with other research
                          groups at the WELL center, we developed
                          statistical machine learning strategies for
                          informing real time individualized sequences

                          trackers, heart rate monitors). These modeling
                          strategies have been applied to predict
                          dietary lapses and affect liability for

                          As the amount of data being generated is
                          exploding, we have entered the era of Big
                          Data. To the extent that data can be analyzed,
                          we may be able to gain a completely new
                          perspective on our world, on how people
                          interact, spend their resources, and organize
                          their time. Data mining involves using
                          algorithms and experience to extract patterns
                          that are either very complex, difficult or
                          time consuming to identify. In contrast to
                          traditional hypothesis-driven approaches to
                          analysis, data mining techniques enables
                          researchers to assess the predictive value of
                          all possible combinations of variables in a
                          data set. Data mining has emerged in recent
                          years as a major area of statistical research
                          and practice and is increasingly employed by

                          In traditional statistical analysis, we assume
                          many observations and a few, well-chosen
                          variables.&nbsp; The trend today is towards
                          more observations but even more so, to much
                          larger number of variables. If the number of
                          variables can greatly exceed the number of
                          observations, we call this type of data
                          high-dimensional data. High dimensionality
                          brings noise accumulation, spurious
                          correlations and incidental homogeneity. The
                          complexity and high dimensionality of data
                          pose great challenges and difficulties for
                          information extraction and data analysis.<br>
                          <br>
                          Over the past few years, significant
                          developments have been made in
                          high-dimensional data analysis, driven
                          primarily by a broad range of applications in
                          many fields such as neuroimaging, genomics,
                          and social network data. In our lab, we have
                          been focused on areas of feature selection,
                          classification, regression and dimension
                          reduction. For example, we developed feature
                          selection and classification strategies for
                          brain decoding using fMRI data as well as
                          imaging mass spectrometry data.</font><br>

                        <br>
                        Bayesian inference is a type of statistical
                        inference in which the probability for a
                        hypothesis is updated based on Bayes’ theorem as
                        more information becomes available. A key
                        element of the Bayesian inference is to treat
                        parameters as random variables instead of fixed
                        constants. This approach requires a prior
                        distribution for each unknown parameters whose
                        distribution is updated as a posterior
                        distribution. Bayesian analysis provides a
                        natural and principal way of combining prior
                        information with data. In addition, it provides
                        a flexible setting for a wide range of models
                        such as hierarchical models. <br>
                        <br>
                        In one of our projects, we developed a Bayesian
                        spatially varying coefficient model to
                        incorporate spatial information among brain
                        voxels for fMRI data. By incoroporating the
                        spatial prior information, our approach is shown
                        to be effective in identifying the truly
                        localized patterns of the voxels while
                        maintaining robustness to discover truly
                        distributed pattern.</font><br>
